## **5. Technical Implementation Details**

### **5.1 Evaluation Methodology**

#### **5.1.1 F1 Score Calculation**
```python
# Simulated predictions based on humor quality scores
if humor_score >= 7.0:
    y_pred.append(1)  # Predicted funny
elif humor_score >= 5.0:
    y_pred.append(1 if np.random.random() > 0.3 else 0)  # 70% chance funny
else:
    y_pred.append(0)  # Predicted not funny
```

#### **5.1.2 MSE Calculation**
```python
# Normalize humor scores to 0-1 range for prediction
normalized_score = min(max(humor_score / 10.0, 0.0), 1.0)
mse = np.mean([(pred - true) ** 2 for pred, true in zip(y_pred, y_true)])
```

#### **5.1.3 Personalization Benefit Scoring**
```python
# Weighted combination of improvements
weights = {
    'f1_score': 0.30,    # Humor quality assessment
    'mse': 0.25,         # Prediction accuracy
    'surprisal': 0.20,   # Humor unexpectedness
    'ambiguity': 0.15,   # Multiple interpretations
    'humor_quality': 0.10 # Overall quality
}
```
