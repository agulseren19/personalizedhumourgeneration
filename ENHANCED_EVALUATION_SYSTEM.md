# Enhanced Evaluation System for Cards Against Humanity

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced evaluation system implemented for the Cards Against Humanity humor generation platform. The system now includes sophisticated surprise index calculation based on Tian et al.'s research and intelligent, context-aware persona selection for both generation and evaluation.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Surprise Index Calculation

#### Based on Tian et al. (2020) - Incongruity Theory

The surprise index is now calculated using a comprehensive approach that measures:

- **Lexical Surprise**: Uncommon words that increase unexpectedness
- **Semantic Distance**: How different the humor is from the context
- **Surprise Indicators**: Explicit words that signal incongruity
- **Length Complexity**: Unexpected structural patterns
- **Distinct-n Style Originality**: Prevents repetition and promotes creativity

#### Implementation Details

```python
class SurpriseCalculator:
    """Enhanced Surprise Index Calculator based on Tian et al. (2020) - Incongruity Theory"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Common words that reduce surprise (baseline language model vocabulary)
        self.common_words = {'the', 'a', 'an', 'and', 'or', 'but', ...}
        
        # Surprise indicator words that increase incongruity
        self.surprise_indicators = [
            'unexpected', 'bizarre', 'absurd', 'random', 'weird', 'strange',
            'quantum', 'existential', 'surreal', 'ironic', 'paradox', ...
        ]
```

#### Scoring Algorithm

1. **Lexical Surprise** (Weight: 4.0): Ratio of uncommon words
2. **Semantic Distance** (Weight: 3.0): Context overlap reduction
3. **Surprise Indicators** (Weight: 1.5): Explicit incongruity markers
4. **Length Complexity** (Weight: 2.0): Structural unexpectedness
5. **Word Diversity** (Weight: 0.5): Distinct-n style originality
6. **Punctuation Patterns** (Weight: 0.3): Syntactic surprise
7. **Content Patterns** (Weight: 0.8): Advanced incongruity detection

### 2. Context-Aware Persona Selection

#### Generation Persona Selection

The system now intelligently selects generation personas based on:

- **Audience Alignment**: Family-friendly vs. adult humor preferences
- **Topic Expertise**: Domain-specific knowledge and humor styles
- **Humor Style Compatibility**: Clean vs. edgy content alignment
- **Diversity Factor**: Random element to prevent monotony

#### Evaluation Persona Selection

Evaluation personas are selected using sophisticated scoring:

- **Audience Alignment** (Weight: 3.0): High priority for context matching
- **Topic Expertise** (Weight: 2.0): Medium priority for domain knowledge
- **Generation Compatibility** (Weight: 2.0): Avoid same persona for generation/evaluation
- **Evaluation Style** (Weight: 1.0): Low priority for style matching
- **Diversity Factor** (Weight: 0.5): Very low random factor

### 3. CrewAI Integration

#### Enhanced Evaluation Agents

```python
class HumorEvaluationAgent:
    def __init__(self, evaluator_persona: EvaluatorPersona, model_name: str = None):
        # Create CrewAI agent with enhanced evaluation capabilities
        self.agent = Agent(
            role=f"Advanced Humor Evaluator - {evaluator_persona.name}",
            goal="Evaluate humor quality across multiple dimensions using sophisticated criteria",
            backstory=f"{evaluator_persona.description}. You are an expert evaluator who understands humor theory, incongruity, and surprise."
        )
```

#### Evaluation Criteria

The enhanced evaluation now considers:

1. **Humor Score**: How funny/clever, considering unexpectedness and surprise
2. **Creativity Score**: Originality and creative approach
3. **Appropriateness Score**: Audience fit and content safety
4. **Context Relevance**: How well it works with the black card
5. **Surprise Index**: Incongruity and unexpectedness measurement

### 4. Overall Score Calculation

The new scoring system incorporates surprise index:

```python
overall_score = (
    scores['humor'] * 0.35 + 
    scores['creativity'] * 0.25 + 
    scores['appropriateness'] * 0.20 + 
    scores['context'] * 0.10 +
    (surprise_index / 10.0) * 0.10  # Include surprise index
)
```

## Frontend Integration

### Display Updates

The frontend now shows:

- **Surprise Index**: New metric displayed alongside other scores
- **Enhanced Scoring**: All evaluation dimensions visible
- **Evaluator Insights**: Information about the evaluation persona used

### API Response Structure

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "generations": [
    {
      "id": "persona_model_timestamp",
      "text": "Generated humor text",
      "persona_name": "Persona Name",
      "humor_score": 8.5,
      "creativity_score": 7.8,
      "appropriateness_score": 9.2,
      "context_relevance_score": 8.1,
      "surprise_index": 7.6,
      "is_safe": true,
      "toxicity_score": 0.1
    }
  ],
  "evaluator_insights": {
    "name": "Evaluator Persona",
    "reasoning": "Evaluation criteria description",
    "evaluation_criteria": "Specific criteria used"
  }
}
```
